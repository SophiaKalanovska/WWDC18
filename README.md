# WWDC18
In my application, I have used several technologies: XCPlayground, UIKit, PlaygroundSupport ,GameplayKit and AVFoundation. After launching the playground, a number of shuffled cards with their faces down appear on the screen. The user turns over a maximum of two cards at a time and if they match, the instrument illustrated on them begins to play. With every other matching pair of cards, another sound layers up on top of the previous ones and in the end, a complete melody is created.
